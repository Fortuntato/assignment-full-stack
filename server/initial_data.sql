It will draw on the research findings from 17-003 to determine what is required and identify solutions which fit these requirements.
      This project will identify existing, near to market and novel approaches for technological solutions suitable for use on the current and future GB rail network and make recommendations based on the expected benefits, cost and impact of these solutions.
      The solutions will provide drivers with an indication of train stopping position that correlates with train length and ensure all passenger doors intended for use are accommodated within the platform. The indication should ideally be presented in-cab, clearly visible from the driver''s normal seated position, thus reducing the need for a side view window to be provided as part of the train build design. Other technological examples include the introduction of dynamic illuminated signage which detects the specific train arriving and provides tailored information on the stopping position.
      This will enable the industry to determine its future path with relation to enabling drivers to stop trains in the correct position at stations.
      Following completion of this project it is envisaged trialling of suitable solutions could be undertaken.','4868ef41-eb50-4c28-a958-b226e1f40bb5','2020-11-12','2020-12-09','75000','GBP','2020-11-12 23:45:32.126','TENDER'),

All tender information MUST be submitted through the Delta eSourcing Portal. Early research by the UK Space Growth Partnership (SGP) indicates that the role of Government as an ''anchor customer'' in procurement could provide an important element in ensuring an innovative and competitive space market in the UK, and provide leverage into the global market for UK companies. The SGP has considered in particular the impact for Government securing access to new and early services, influencing industry developments to meet public sector needs, transferring risk to the private sector and achieving better value for money than traditional R&D and procurement programmes. In addition, the SGP has considered the soft power benefits as Government becomes the smart customer of the future and promotes the UK''s international reputation as an innovation leader in important market segments.

The SGP review of the ''anchor customer'' principle included consideration of many satellite communications and Earth observation examples in other countries, as well as the role NASA has played in using public procurement to stimulate the US commercial launch sector, where SpaceX has now emerged as a global leader.

The goal of this study is to evaluate innovative procurement mechanisms as a tool for establishing global leadership in the space sector. The study should specifically assess the anchor customer principle for its ability to:
•	attract private investment
•	deliver practical procurement processes that work in a range of market situations
•	set UK businesses apart as leaders for reliable service delivery
•	accelerate technology innovation
•	stimulate jobs and growth across the UK, explicitly aligning domestic requirements and the drive for exports

Lot 1:
The Isle of Wight Council (the Council), with the support of Visit Isle of Wight are launching an initiative to find a partner or consortia to assist in developing the Dinosaur Isle Museum in Sandown. It is our hope to create a nationally important visitor destination within Sandown; enhancing the museum’s appeal as an attraction, and further developing its potential as an important regional educational centre and a world-class scientific resource. We are seeking a partner to help us improve the physical facilities and deliver overall long-term governance, while assuring the museum’s continued participation in the museum accreditation standard. We are spreading the net widely for potential partners to ensure the best potential future for the museum and the town. To achieve this, we will be promoting this opportunity internationally to identify a partner with the track record, expertise and vision to take forward our aspirations and fulfil the full potential of Dinosaur Isle. As such, we would welcome responses from public sector, private sector and voluntary sector organisations, and mixed consortia. Following a Soft Market Testing exercises in October 2017 and Stakeholder Consultation in November 2017, and considering comments and issues raised, the Council made a decision in May 2018 to seek a Development Partner for the museum through a formal procurement process. The process will be based on a multi-stage “Competitive Procedure with Negotiation”. However, as a museum service falls under the Light Touch Regime (Regulations 74-77 of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015) the process has not been prescribed as detailed by Regulation, and is being designed to suit the specific requirements of this procurement. At each stage of the process bidders will be assessed based on information submitted and some may be eliminated if they do not score sufficiently against the criteria. Only those bidders remaining at the appropriate stage will be invited to submit Final Tenders. At the conclusion of the process, the Council intends to form an agreement with the successful bidder to work alongside the Council as the Development Partner in manner in accordance with their Final Tender. The Development Partner must invest in and operate the museum so as to develop its role as an accredited museum acting as a significant visitor attraction for the Isle of Wight. In return they will secure a contract to operate the museum with a long-lease for the site and rights to a proportion of any income generated. It is expected that the Council and Development Partner will commit to redesigning and delivering an enhanced Dinosaur Isle Museum (the Museum) within three-years of the conclusion of the selection process. The term of the contract will be determined via this process; however, the Council will be prepared to issue a lease of up to 125 years, subject to conditions.

7. How will initial tender submissions be evaluated
How will initial tender submissions be evaluated  The Authority reserves the right to consider tenderers non-compliant if their points are below 2 on any essential criteria. Tenderers may also be considered non-compliant if their proposed start date is after the required start date or if their day rate/pricing is above the stated budget. Non-compliant tenderers will be excluded from the competition and their total technical evaluation points will be 0.Tenderers with the three highest total technical evaluation points from this evaluation will be down selected and invited to take part in stage two.

8. How will final tender submissions be evaluated after initial down selection. Part 1
TechnicalIn addition to the initial submission, Tenderers will be asked to provide: cultural fit statements max 100 words each.Each tenderer will be evaluated and re-allocated 0 (Not Met), 1 (Partially Met), 2 (Met) or 3 (Exceeded) against each of the essential and nice to have criteria, based on their initial and final tender submissions. Any additional proposal criteria will also be assessed in this same way.

9. How will final tender submissions be evaluated after initial down selection. Part 2
The points awarded for each criteria will be added together to give the total technical evaluation points. The total points allocated may differ between the initial and final submissions. The total technical points will be divided by the maximum available technical points and multiplied by the technical criteria weighting. This will give the technical score.(For example, if tender has 30 points, the maximum points available was 35 and the technical weighting is 70, the technical score will be 30/35 = 0.85 x 70 = 60)

10. How will final tender submissions be evaluated after initial down selection. Part 2
CulturalTenderers will provide a cultural fit statement to show how they will meet each of the cultural fit criteria. This will include social value, if required.Each tenderer will be allocated 0 (Not Met), 1 (Partially Met), 2 (Met) or 3 (Exceeded) against their responses to each of the cultural criteria.

11. How will final tender submissions be evaluated after initial down selection. Part 4
The points awarded for each criteria will be added together to form the total cultural evaluation points. The total cultural points will be divided by the maximum available cultural points and multiplied by the cultural criteria weighting. This will give the cultural score.(For example, if tender has 20 points, the maximum points available was 25 and the cultural weighting is 10, the cultural score will be 20/25 = 0.8 x 10 = 8)

12. How will final tender submissions be evaluated after initial down selection. Part 5
FinancialFor specialists, the day rate provided at initial tender submission will be the pricing figure.The lowest compliant pricing figure will be divided by the tenderers pricing figure and multiplied by the financial criteria weighting. This will give the financial score.(For example, if the lowest price was £1000, the tenderers price was £2000 and the financial weighting is 20, the financial score will be  1000/2000 + 0.5 x 20 = 10)

13. How will final tender submissions be evaluated after initial down selection. Part 6
CombinedThe Authority reserves the right to consider tenderers non-compliant if they score below a 2 on any essential criteria. Tenderers may also be considered non-compliant if their proposed start date is after the required start date or if their day rate is above the stated budget.

The last should be a larger robot, able to move around and capable of interacting with objects on a table.
We require the robots for the following activities within the IROHMS lab:
Children’s interaction with robotic technology. This stream of work centres on enhancing the acceptability and reliability of humanoid robot interactions for children. Using CUCHDS’ existing neuroimaging technologies, this can explore the activation of social neural networks during CRI and use this to inform basic robotics development. Complementary psychological experimental paradigms that will inform these advancements include movement paradigms, perspective taking, eye-gaze cueing and joint attention. Atypically developing children, particularly autistic children, may perceive a humanoid robot’s appearance and behaviours differently from other children. Thus, the work will also focus on adapting humanoid robots to meet individual differences.
Social cognition and behaviour. This stream capitalises on the breadth of CUCHDS research that explores social cognition and behaviour. For example, combined with motion capture software, we will use time-series analysis to offer a fine-grained exploration of the social synchrony between child and robot, with CRI offering experimental control not afforded in human-human interactions. Further, autistic children may find humanoid robots more predictable and easier to understand than humans, which offers exciting possibilities for exploring social strategies and interaction styles. As well as informing basic understanding of social cognition and behaviour in typical and atypical development, this work has potential to lead to interventions for children with neurodevelopmental disorders and emotional and behavioural difficulties.
Integration with existing IROHMS capabilities. Other zones within the IROHMS lab, such as the transport simulator and immersive dome (Igloo) provide opportunities for using different technologies to explore Human-Robot Interaction scenarios.

Temptation Pâtisserie was set up by twin sisters, Kate and Ruth, at the end of 2020 in Co. Laois. We produce artisan handmade chocolates and pâtisseries, specialising in hand painted bonbons. Chocolate must be ‘tempered’ and is an essential step for stabilising the crystals in chocolate, making a smooth, glossy finish, helps chocolate to stay solid in warmer temperatures and improves shelf life. This is currently done manually by hand for each type of chocolate we use e.g. milk, dark and white and is a very time consuming, labour intensive process. Funding is sought in order to purchase specialised machinery, i.e. tempering machines, which will carry out this process automatically, hugely enhancing our production ability in order to expand to meet market and shop commitments.

The project scope is to build and fly a satellite quantum key distribution (QKD) test bed. Through this collaboration, Singapore and the UK will co-develop a satellite called "Speqtre"", a satellite based on the CubeSat standard that will use a pioneering QKD technology to test the secure distribution of cryptographic keys over globe-spanning distances. Quantum Key Distribution provides an alternative that can be seamlessly integrated onto the network systems we already use. It is resistant to all known computational attacks, including from future quantum computers. The project was kicked off around Feb 2019 and is currently around PDR stage. The satellite is expected to be launched around Q3/Q4 2023. In the UK, work will be led by the STFC, responsible for the development of the platform (BUS) and the optical payload for optical links needed for beaming QKD signals, known as the ''Optical Payload''.

In a wider initiative to promote walking and cycling as part of a green and healthy recovery from COVID 19 the Secretary of State for Transport announced the acceleration of E-Scooter trials planned for 2021.

This Trial represents an opportunity to understand the potential role of electric scooters in the mobility ecosystem of the West Midlands. The Department for Transport (DfT) issued further guidance for undertaking E-scooter trials on the 8 June 2020 and this guidance and any subsequent national guidance and/or legislation will also directly inform the design, implementation and operation of the Trial.

Please see below link to DfT legislation and eScooter guidance:
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/e-scooter-trials-guidance-for-local-areas-and-rental-operators/

The opportunity is a concession arrangement to operate an E-scooter trial in the West Midlands Combined Authority area. The concession arrangement is below the threshold for the Concession Contracts Regulations 2016 (CCR2016) and accordingly the WMCA and TfWM have elected to issue an OJEU notice voluntarily in order to facilitate cross border interest in the Trial. The procurement process will adhere to the relevant principles of the CCR2016 and the procurement timetable and process itself is predicated on an equitable but flexible approach.

The scope of the Trial is comprised of a Core Trial Area and Additional Trial Area. The outcome of this procurement is to appoint one or a maximum of two operators to initiate the Trial in the Core Trial Area. Should the WMCA and TfWM be minded to expand the Trial to the Additional Trial Area the selected operator(s) appointed will be requested to extended operations subject to the appropriate contractual mechanisms being observed.

The Core Trial Area comprises the following three Zones:
• Zone 1 - Birmingham (1 trial area in Zone)
• Zone 2 - Coventry, Kenilworth & Solihull (2 trial areas contained in the Zone)
• Zone 3 - Wolverhampton, Walsall & Sandwell (3 trial areas contained in the Zone)

Each of the Zones has designated trial areas. It is possible that further trial areas may be added to one or more of the Zones during the course of the arrangement at the discretion of the WMCA and TfWM.

The Additional Trial Area comprises:
• Dudley
• Warwick & Leamington
• West Birmingham extension also linking to Sandwell area.

Tenderers are advised that any and all travel required for the undertaking of these surveys is currently (April 2020) considered to be non-essential, in the context of Government’s Covid-19 guidance and restrictions.

This year the UK will host the world''s major climate conference, COP26 (26th session of the Conference of Parties), in November. As a result, helping to raise awareness of the challenges of climate change and bringing about greater action to tackle them are the UK''s priorities for 2020.   We want to use the QBP to celebrate what the UK and India are together in this area: across Green tech, electric vehicles and biodiversity as well as other areas.
Our ''Green themed QBP for 2020'' will showcase UK messages on green issues through bill board branding, photo opportunities, videos and displays.
It is also very important that the event itself is sustainable - we are looking for green solutions throughout the event to make sure that we are e.g. not using single use plastic, limiting energy use and "practicing what we preach".','57146fc5-1c87-4fd1-8247-c17fb168fa12','2020-02-19','2020-03-05',NULL,NULL,'2020-02-19 11:45:45.478','TENDER');
